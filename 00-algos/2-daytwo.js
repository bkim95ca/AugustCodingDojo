var amazingShow1="Curb your enthusiasm is #1 ! yay :)"; //this is a variable that is equal to a string
var magicNumber = 23;

amazingShow1 = "The office"; // this is an example of reassigning the variable amazingShow1 to e equal to "the office"

var isRobSpeakingFactsAboutBasketball = false; //booleans are another data type: true or false

//a data type is a simple piece of informatio such as a string, number, boolean

//a data structure is something that can store multiple data types (arrays, objects(hash maps), trees, linked lists)

//an array is a data structure where you can group multiple pieces of information together
var greatestArtists=["Drake", "J.Cole", "Kendrick", "Kanye", "2Pac", "Beyonce", "Taylor Swift"]; //array of string
//indices (positions)   0       1
//actual values you see in the array are called: ELEMENTS

var randomNums = [23, 0, 77, 12, 8]; //array of numbers

var mixedArray = ["Potato", 5, false, true, "hello", 9]; //this is a mixed array- mixed data types

//a loop is used to do something repeatedly
//for loop increments i before looking at the conditional

// for(var i=0; i<10; i++) { //then increments 3++ 7++, 11++ and 11++ would be our final i
    // console.log(i); //0, 4, 8
    // i = i + 3; //then 0+3, 7, 11
// }
    
// console.log("outside of the loop " + i) i is 11++ or 12;

//outputs are 0, 4, 8, outside of the loop 12
